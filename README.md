# Smart-Traffic-Management

<p align="justify">Traffic congestion is a major problem in metropolitan areas of India, and traditional approaches to managing traffic have proven ineffective as vehicle density increases. This project aims to address this issue by implementing a real- time signal monitoring and handling approach using the YOLOv3 algorithm. YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection algorithm that accurately identifies vehicles in videos, live feeds, or images. By counting the number of vehicles on each side of the road and dynamically adjusting signal switching based on this count, the project aims to improve traffic management. The vehicle count is obtained using ESP32 and LED lights are used to toggle the signal. The switching time of the signal is determined based on real-time image detection, providing accurate results even in dense traffic. The project involves comparing object counts from different cameras to perform signal switching dynamically.
Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing traffic signal switching and has a significant impact on traffic flow and safety in urban transportation management. This project provides an abstract of the latest research in this field, focusing on deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and YOLO networks for predicting traffic patterns. Additionally, the project explores the use of reinforcement learning to optimize signal switching policies based on real-time traffic data. The results demonstrate that deep learning-based smart traffic management can effectively reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety. This approach has the potential to revolutionize urban transportation management, but further research is required to fully evaluate its effectiveness and address implementation challenges.</p>
